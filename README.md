# Google Sheet Questionaire

A configurable quiz based on a google spreadsheet, for Wikimedia's distant socializing experiment.

## How it works

This code is meant to run on a Google App Script, and uses `.clasp` as a deployment tool. It can potentially be used for other spreadsheets by changing the configured structure and design.

## Contributing

As always, pull requests and issue reporting is very welcome!

While this code is meant to run on a Google App Script that's connected to a spreadsheet, it can also be run locally for development.

To run locally:

- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run local` to load the system locally based on mock data.
